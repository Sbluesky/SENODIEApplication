Building an e-commerce product recommendation system
On an e-commerce website like Sendo.vn, there are millions of customers and millions of products. In order to provide a customer with a great shopping experience, it is important to understand his or her preferences and recommend to him / her products that are most likely of his / her interest. By providing personalized product recommendations, the website will also greatly improve its revenues. Given Sendo's proprietary dataset of historical customer behavior data (e.g., the products that a particular customer has viewed in the past), how would you build an effective product recommendation system using machine learning?

This dataset will not activated because of security issue.

This repository just show you a way to clean dataset and use Item-item (User - User) collaborative filtering for building a recommendation system. If you want to see complete system, go to github link in LinkGitHubSENODIEApplication.txt file.
